<section class='post-content'><p>This week I am working on a project for <a href="http://mintdigital.com" rel="nofollow">mint digital</a> and I came across something that inspired me to write my first of many blog posts. So without further a do lets go ahead and dive straight into some code.</p>

<p>To begin with I had the following models:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>class Author &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :books
end

class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :author
  # state =&gt; ['live', 'hold', 'sold']
end
</code></pre>
<p>Currently the author model does not have a &lsquo;state&rsquo;, I was in a situation where I wanted to be able to find out if an author was on &#39;sale&rsquo;. By that I mean, if the author has any associated books with the state of &#39;live&rsquo;. My first thought was, it would either involve a resource heavy loop (this is espcially true if the author has thousands of books), or it would involve a hard to implement and difficult to reuse SQL statement. Both of which did not seem particualaly apealing.</p>

<p>I decided the best thing to do is add a boolean field to the <code>Author</code> model named <code>listed_for_sale</code>, this field would then be updated each time a book was created, updated or deleted. Doing it this way would make it easy to find out if an author is on sale or not by simply calling <code>listed_for_sale?</code> which would return true/false.</p>

<p>So I added the field <code>listed_for_sale</code> to the author model:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>rails g migration AddListedForSaleColumnToAuthor listed_for_sale:boolean
# I then added a default value by appending the below to the add_column call
default: false
rake db:migrate
</code></pre>
<p>Then I add the following to the models:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code># app/models/author.rb

def update_listed_for_sale!
  state = books.any? { |book| book.state == 'live' }
  self.listed_for_sale = state
  self.save
end

# app/models/book.rb

after_commit :update_book_author

def update_book_author
  author.update_listed_for_sale!
end

</code></pre>
<p>The problem with the above code is that it will update the field regardless of whether the field has changed in value or not. So I needed to add a check to the <code>update_listed_for_sale!</code> method so that it is only updated when really necessary. I altered the method to look like the below:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code># app/models/author

def update_listed_for_sale!
  state = books.any? { |book| book.state == 'live' }
  self.listed_for_sale = state
  self.save if self.listed_for_sale_changed?
end

</code></pre>
<p>I wrote a quick test and ran the test suite, and it worked successfully. However something didn&rsquo;t feel right. I looked at the method on author, although it does exactly what it is meant to do, it just felt clunky or un ruby like. So I did some exploration and played around with the console. That is when I found <code>update_attributes</code>, I had used this previously to update the attributes of a model without having to explicitly call save. However there seems to be an awesome bit of sugar lying the the depths of the method which I don&rsquo;t feel is documented well enough. It does the exact same check I am after. I.e. It will only update the field if the field has changed in value. That meant I was able to go ahead and reduce the method to one line:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code># app/models/author.rb

def update_listed_for_sale!
  update_attributes(:listed_for_sale, books.any? { |book| book.state == 'live' })
end
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty neat right? So there you go, go ahead and use update_attributes whenever you can, it&rsquo;s just one of many places where rails has got your back!</p>
